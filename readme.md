Prebuilt binaries of the Ghidra reverse engineering tool 
## Probably only for windows idk  
all credits goes to https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra  
releasing this cuz theres no 10.3 in releases in official github as of yet  
note that the "ghidra_10.3_DEV" is the release unzipped, so you should be able to get it working simply by running the bat file inside the folder
